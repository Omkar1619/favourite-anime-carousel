## Description
The purpose of this project is only to record my learnings.

I essentially wanted to learn how to create an image carousel. So I found a video to help me do just that!

## Description

Kevin Powell shows how to make an image carousel using html, css and vanilla js.

I mostly followed along with his video but instead of using random images, I made a carousel of images of my favourite anime.

## Future Plans

I am yet to optimize the site so that it would work on different devices so learning responsive design is the next step.

I plan on learning about media queries and other stuff that helps making a site responsive and I will keep on updating this site to inculcate everything that I learn.

## What I Learned

This is essentially a record of the new stuff that I learned while making this project so that I can refer to it later. It simply enlists things such as cdd properties or js functions that I learned while I created this project.

1. `object-fit: cover`:

The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an `<img>` or `<video>` should be resized to fit its container.
The object-fit property can take one of the following values:

  * fill - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit.

  * contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension.

  * cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit.

  * none - The image is not resized.

  * scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain.
